# Employee Attrition Prediction using Logistic Regression

This project is a Machine Learning Classification System that predicts whether an employee is likely to leave the company (Attrition) or stay based on employee-related features such as job role, income, work-life balance, satisfaction, overtime, etc.

The main model used in this project is Logistic Regression, a widely used algorithm for binary classification problems.

## Project Overview

Employee attrition is a major challenge for companies because losing employees increases hiring cost and reduces productivity.

This project uses machine learning to predict employee attrition early, helping HR teams to take preventive actions.

## Objectives

Load and understand employee attrition dataset

Perform preprocessing (handling categorical + numeric features)

Train a Logistic Regression model

Evaluate the model using classification metrics

Predict whether an employee will leave or stay

## Model Used
### Logistic Regression

Used for binary classification

Target: Attrition (Yes / No)

Simple and interpretable model for HR analytics

## Dataset

### The dataset contains employee-related features such as:

Age

Gender

Years at Company

Job Role

Monthly Income

Work-Life Balance

Job Satisfaction

Overtime

Promotions

Education Level

Company Reputation

Employee Recognition

Attrition (Target)

## Technologies Used

Python
